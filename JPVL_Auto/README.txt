Description:
============

JPVL_Auto is an application which generates vocabulary lists for Japanese language texts. 
It takes image(s) (.jpg or .png) or documents(s) (.docx) as input and will scan these files for Japanese words. 
The application will then generate a word document with a table containing the reading (hiragana or katakana) and the english definition(s) of all the words in the input file. See 'Output Examples' folder for an example of what this looks like.

There are some images and documents you can use to test the program in the 'Sample Images' and 'Sample Documents' folder.

The program contains a customised version of the Jamdict package (Japanese-to-English dictionary for Python).

Usage:
============
